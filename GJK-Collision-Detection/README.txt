# GJK
Interactive tool for visualizing the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi 
(distance) algorithm which is used to detect collision 
between 2 convex polygons here.

gjk_algorithm.py is a detailed 2D implementation of the algorithm in Python3. 
Refer to gjk_initial_publication.pdf for more information about 
the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm.

Run gjk_main.py to visualize GJK.
