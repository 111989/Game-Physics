# A-Shortest-Path
The first and second (left) clicks of the mouse will help you choose 
the "Start" and "Destination" points. Any further left clicks will 
set "Obstacles." Press Space Bar to witness the algorithm find 
the shortest path between the selected points.


Running the code: Examples:

python astar.py
python astar.py --width 800 --height 500 --n 50


You have the option to choose the display dimensions and the number of 
cells in each direction. The display will be "width" wide and "height" 
tall. It will be treated as an (nxn) matrix, therefore "n" must 
completely divide both "width" and "height." All inputs must 
be integer valued, however, they all are optional.
